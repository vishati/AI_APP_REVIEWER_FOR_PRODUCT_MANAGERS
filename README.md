# AI_Driven_App_Feedback_Analysis

## Project Overview

The **AI_Driven_App_Feedback_Analysis** project focuses on analyzing customer feedback from mobile applications using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This project aims to extract meaningful insights from user reviews, enabling app developers and product managers to enhance user experience and drive product improvements. By employing sentiment analysis and topic modeling, this project provides a comprehensive understanding of user sentiments, common issues, and features appreciated by users. 

## Workflow
- **Data Scraping**: We scrape user reviews from the Google Play Store using web scraping techniques. <br/>
- **Data Storage**: The collected reviews are stored in a structured format (CSV or database) for further processing.<br/>
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The raw data undergoes cleaning to remove unnecessary characters, HTML tags, and duplicates. The text is then tokenized, normalized, and prepared for analysis.<br/>
- **Text Processing**: We then perform tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and lemmatization.<br/>
- **Sentiment Analysis**: We utilize TextBlob for sentiment analysis to determine the polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of each review.<br/>
- **Topic Modeling**: Leveraging the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model, we identify and extract key topics from the reviews.<br/>
- **Insight Generation**: Using the Cohere AI API, we generate insights based on the extracted topics and sentiments. The generated insights are processed for clarity and relevance.<br/>
- **Visual Analytics**: We create visual representations of the findings, including word clouds, bar charts for sentiment distribution, and trends over time.<br/>

## Key Objectives

- **Data Scraping**: Collect user reviews from the Google Play Store.
- **Data Storage**: Store the scraped data for further processing.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **Text Processing**: Apply various NLP techniques to prepare the text data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluate user sentiments in app reviews to categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Topic Modeling**: Identify prevalent topics discussed in user feedback using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- **Generative AI Insights**: Use the Cohere AI API to generate actionable insights based on the processed data.
- **Visual Analytics**: Create visualizations to depict sentiment trends over time and highlight common topics in user reviews.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Scrape user reviews from the Google Play Store, focusing on their content, sentiment, and other relevant metadata.
- **Data Processing**: Conduct data cleaning, preprocessing, and text processing to prepare the data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Scoring**: Utilize NLP libraries to analyze and score the sentiment of reviews.
- **Topic Identification**: Employ LDA to extract and present the most discussed topics among users.
- **Generative AI Insights**: Generate insights and recommendations from the analyzed data using the Cohere AI API inference.
- **Visualization Tools**: Create graphs and charts to visualize sentiment trends and the frequency of identified topics, presented in a clean and neat format.
